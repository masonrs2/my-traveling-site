It was a very hot day, but the ruins were very interesting, particularly because of how long they've been around while maintaining it's original structure. I learned a lot about the Mayan culture, who are my ancestors, since I am Mexican having both my parents who were born in Mexico. I'm grateful for having visited one oc the 7 wonders of the world.",
